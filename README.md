## Description

Source code for my [website](https://zeling.me)

## Motivation:

I have recently become intereted in making a personal site (blog). But I 
am really confused by various static site generators. I am going to keep
this simple and stupid by using Makefile and racket rather than using an
overly complicated framework.
