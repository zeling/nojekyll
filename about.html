<div class="content"><h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This site initially serves as a proof of concept that we don't need static site generators to write blogs, instead
we can make the process really easy with Makefile and <a href="https://racket-lang.org">a good programming language</a>.
I plan to explain this in the near future and make it to be the first post of this blog.</p>
<p>I am not a web designer, so please bear with me for the terrible web design. I tried to make the content more readable, the CSS stylesheet
of this site is based on (blatantly copied from) <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site</a>. The good news is that unlike
some other sites, I won't add any suspicious particle effects whose meaning remains unclear.</p>
<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a programmer currently living in the US. You can find my other online identities from <a href="https://keybase.io/zeling">Keybase</a>.</p></div>
